Welcome to the SimpleGradebook Application. This application was created in Atlanta, Georgia June 1, 2013 
for the Peace Corps. It was conceptualized, brainstormed, created, and tested within a 24 hour period at the 
Hack For Change Atlanta Hackathon. There are a lot of features that we wanted to implement didn't make it - sorry folks! 


SHORT OVERVIEW
SimpleGradebook is a simple class management tool for teachers in developing nations. Data is stored locally. The tool
is lightweight and intuitive, doesn't require internet, and can create and print student reports either per student, or 
per class. The program must be set up by a translator beforehand for each language (See below). Its a good idea to 
have a copy of the original files (that way you don't copy over student and class data)


MODIFYING LANGUAGES
There is a CSV file located at _____________________. In order to change the language, have the translator
open up the .CSV (either in excel, or notepad) and translate the english words over to the needed language. 
We hope that this allows the application to be used in as many countries as possible. This CFG file can be copied and 
pasted into other user's directories to quickly update the language. Do not rename this (or any) files! 

DEVELOPED FOR x32 
This section probably doesn't matter much to you, but...
This application was built with x32 compatibility - we did this so that as many computers as possible could run it. 
If you are running x64, you should be able to (in Windows) right click, and run as x32 compatability mode
